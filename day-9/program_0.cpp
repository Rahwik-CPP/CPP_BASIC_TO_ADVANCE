/*
As friend function is not a member of class,
it does not require object for its invocation.
Therefore the first argument of operator need not be
object of the class for which operator is being overloaded.
However at least one of the operands must be the object of
the class for which operator is being overloaded.
Both Unary as well as binary operators can be overloaded
through friend function.
